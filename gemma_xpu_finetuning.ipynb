    "1. Setting up the environment and optimizing it for Intel GPUs\n",
    "2. Initializing the XPU and configuring LoRA settings for efficient fine-tuning\n",
    "3. Loading the pre-trained Gemma model and testing its performance\n",
    "4. Preparing a diverse dataset of question-answer pairs covering various domains\n",
    "5. Fine-tuning the model using the Hugging Face `Trainer` class\n",
    "6. Evaluating the fine-tuned model on a test dataset\n",
    "7. Saving and loading the fine-tuned model for future use\n",
    "\n",

    "After finetuning, let's put our model to the test! But before we do that, we need to merge the LoRA weights with the base model. This step is crucial because the LoRA weights contain the learned adaptations from the finetuning process. By merging the LoRA weights, we effectively incorporate the knowledge gained during finetuning into the base model. 🧠💡\n",
    "\n",
    "To merge the LoRA weights, we'll use the `merge_and_unload()` function provided by the PEFT library. This function seamlessly combines the LoRA weights with the corresponding weights of the base model, creating a single unified model that includes the finetuned knowledge. 🎛️🔧\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "After fine-tuning the Gemma model on a diverse question-answering dataset covering topics such as health, politics, technology, and economics, we observed significant improvements in the model's ability to provide accurate and relevant responses to a wide range of queries. The fine-tuned model demonstrated a better understanding of domain-specific terminology and concepts compared to the baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model's performance was evaluated on a held-out test set, and it achieved promising results in terms of accuracy and coherence. The fine-tuned model was able to generate more contextually appropriate and informative responses compared to the generic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that the model's performance may still be limited by the size and diversity of the fine-tuning dataset. Expanding the dataset with more varied questions and answers across different domains could further enhance the model's capabilities and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the fine-tuned model shows promise in assisting users with their information needs across various topics, but it should be used as a complementary tool alongside other reliable sources of information."

    "\n",
    "To push your model to the Hugging Face Model Hub, you'll need to create a repository on the platform and configure your authentication token. Once set up, you can use the push_to_hub() method provided by the transformers library to upload your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pushing your model to the Hugging Face Model Hub allows other researchers and developers to discover, use, and build upon your work. It fosters collaboration and accelerates progress in the field of natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to provide clear documentation and instructions on how to use your model effectively. Include details about the fine-tuning dataset, any specific preprocessing steps, and example usage to make it easier for others to leverage your model in their own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "By sharing your fine-tuned model on the Hugging Face Model Hub, you contribute to the open-source community and enable others to benefit from your work, while also gaining visibility and potential collaborations for your own research and development efforts."
